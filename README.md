# CodeAlpha_Task_1-Simple-E-commerce-Store-
This project is a mini e-commerce website built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript. It displays products, lets users view details, add items to a cart, update or remove them, and proceed to checkout. Orders, cart data, and login info are stored in localStorage, simulating a full shopping flow without a backend.
